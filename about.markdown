This blog is an attempt of collecting various scattered\* scribblings in one place.

The site is statically generated by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is currently hosted in a S3 bucket.

You can take a look [under the hood](https://github.com/folkol/blog.folkol.com.git), if you are so inclined.
