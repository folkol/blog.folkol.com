I take notes.

I'm not particularly good at it — and they are certainly not as organized as I would like them to be — but I take notes. I take notes when I work, I take notes when I read, I take notes when I watch YouTube.

This website is a fledgling attempt of cleaning up, and collecting, some of these scribblings in one place.
