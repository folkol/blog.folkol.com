So, to make factoring as difficult as possible, you want the prime factors to be as large as possible, which means you want N to have the fewest factors possible. With 𝑝 p and 𝑞 q prime, 𝑁 N has two factors. With 𝑝 p and 𝑞 q composite, 𝑁 N has at least four factors, possibly more.

(Also, e.g. RSA is defined in terms of prime numbers, see Euler PHI (even though it is replaced by Carmichaels Totient).)
