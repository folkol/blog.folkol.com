# DuckDB, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjsB6lM2-zw

Analysis workflow: CSV -> Pandas + NumPy in Jupyter

In-process OLAP DBMS, embeddable. No client-server.
Lightweight.

OLTP vs OLAP

OLTP: transactional data, many clients
OLAP: data analysis

Difference: how the data is stored, row-wise or column-wise.

Research: column databases.

Optimized for reading and analysing per-column.

- columnar database
- vectorized processing
- MVCC to be ACID compliant 
- friendlier sequel, exclude/replace/all
- Bindings for Python/R/Java, etc
- Integrations with Pandas, Parquet, Arrow
- "You can think of DuckDB as the SQLite for Analytics"

				Transactional		Analytical
	Embedded	SQLite, SolidDB		DuckDB
	Standalone	PostgreSQL, MySQL	Snowflake, Clickhouse, Redshift

What are the limits?
- single machine, not distributed
- does not need to fit in memory
- single-played experience
- not for transactions
- read-only for concurrent connections

# practice!

SELECT * FROM 'dataset/*.csv'

- uses DuckDB's CSV loader
- infers columns and datatypes

"DuckDB is a relational embeddable analytical DBMS that focuses on supporting analytical query workloads (OLAP)"

To provide transactional guarantees (ACID properties), DuckDB employs its custom bulk-optimized multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) and enables data to be stored in persistent, single-file databases. Additionally, DuckDB supports secondary indexes to speed up queries trying to find a single table entry.

.fetchone or .fetchall, creates Python values for every row retrieved

Also, can use .df() for pandas DataFrame

.fetchnumpy
.df
.fetchdf
.fetch_df
.fetch_df_chunk
.arrow
.fetch_arrow_table
