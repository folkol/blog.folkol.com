            - word traps: commonly used word or phrase that have an unintended negative impact
                - 'I'll do it soon' <-- when is soon?
                - 'I'll try to do that' <-- lack of commitment
                - hedging language


1. Listen to yourself
    - Do you speak in many run-on sentences?
    - Go off on a lot of tangents?
    - Are you hard to understand?

2. Do't be afraid to pronounce
    - Don't mumble, speak up!
    - Fully pronounce each syllable to prevent trailing off when speaking. Doing so also slows you down and gives audiences orem time to understand your thoughts.

3. Keep it simple
    - If you have a lot to say, it's OK to use simple sentences structures when speaking. Speaking in long, winding, sentences will lose the attention of your audience, and can even make you forget what you wanted to say in the first place.

4. Forget the filler
    - Drop the um/uh and like
    - Use instead: 'let's move on to', 'another important consideration is' or 'let's transition to talking about' as replacements.
    - But better of might be to not use fillers at all, say what you have to say.

5. Pay attention to your audience
    - Your audience will play a consistent rol in how you speak.
    - Keep listeners interested in what you have to say by studying their attention levels, for example.
    - Speed up your speech if your audience already understands what you're saying, or speak at the same vocabulary level as listeners.
    - You can vary how high or low your voice is  in order to keep audiences interested.
    - There are many speech-habit variables that you can adjust.
