# Instructions Per Clock

- IPC (Instructions per clock) or ILP (Instruction-level parallelism)

- multiple 2/5: far under max IPC ('stalling pipeline'?)

- loop overheads
- reduce loop overhead by 'unrolling' or 'vectorization'

> '(code) listing 5'

- data dependencies, can't accumulate in some int if we want parallelism
- 'giant serial dependency chain'
- 'the loop maintenance can be done in parallel'
- 'give the CPU more things to do at the same time'
- keep separate tallies and add them in the end?

- x2 the performance chains
