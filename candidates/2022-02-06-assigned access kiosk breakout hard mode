"Kiosk Mode" (Assigned Access): Win10 or 11, can set desktop on "one app mode".

Target: Get shell.

Can't rightclick.

Filtering on file name...

Rename cmd.exe -> msedge.exe.

It worked...

ffs


whoami

runas /user:admin cmd.exe
it's allowed...

'kiosk edge' -> ctrl+p for print dialog -> click help -> opens a real edge... -> open file / downloads dialog -> open explorer.exe

Trick: clobber msedge.exe, but it seems like path is not part of this.. :P

A.k.a. "any executable named msedge.exe" xD


- enumerate files where I can write
