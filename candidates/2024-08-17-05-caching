# Caching! (As in CPU cache)

> How many bytes per cycle can a CPU read in?

- In order to add: Loop overhead / maintenance, loads and stores.

> Multiplier 4/5: Cache

> Understanding the cache layout of your target machine is a big part of performance oriented programming

- Main memory / BUS can't feed the CPU fast enough, need faster caches near-CPU.
- Register file in the core of the CPU, maybe a few hundred values
- Part of the register file is called 'a register' in assembly language

latencies and sizes
- register file: 0, 1K
- L1 cache (per-core): a few instructions, 32K
- L2 cache (per-core): ~14 cycles, 256K
- L3 cache (shared): ~80 cycles, 8M
- RAM: ~150+, ~16G

- managed in 'cache lines' (64bytes)

> ...how much performance we lose by falling out of L1 cache, or maybe even L2 cache, or -- heaven forbid -- fall out to main memory

- push out to L2: change to using more than L1-size integers
- core contention in L3
