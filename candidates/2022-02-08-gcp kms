- GCM isn't a panacea either, however. It is strictly speaking correct, but has proven itself to be far from foolproof in practice:

It fails spectacularly if you reuse a nonce. A single repeated nonce allows an adversary to recover its authentication subkey, plus to learn the XOR of the two messages with the same nonce.
Its nonces are uncomfortably short (96 bits), which can be tricky to use with random nonces.

- CBC doesn't have these problems. Random IVs work just fine (and are in fact required), and if you do repeat an IV you don't get catastrophic failure, you just leak information about equal plaintext prefixes.

man openssl-enc
- PKCS#5 padding (PKCS#7 padding)
- A password will be prompted for to derive the key and IV if necessary.
- The -salt option should ALWAYS be used if the key is being derived from a password unless you want compatibility with previous versions of OpenSSL.
