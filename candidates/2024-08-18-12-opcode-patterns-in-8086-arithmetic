# Opcode Patterns in 8086 Arithmetic

- the basic shape of instructions, OPcode + variable length bits, is there for all kinds of instructions -- not just mov
- various familities have 'extra opcode bits', for example 'arithmetic' is in place 'reg'
- in general, there might be a base version of the instruction with a truncated opcode + something in byte 1 -- but if it needs more extended bits for the opcode it will put them 'somewhere'
- in general: family-prefix + specialization.

- homework: implement add/sub/cmp, plus conditional jumps
