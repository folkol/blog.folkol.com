- shell
	- interprets commands and fork+exec them (and wait for it)

- boot process (anno 1999)
	- when the computer is booted, a boot loader is loading the kernel into memory and calling it
	- the kernel initializes itself and any hardwre that may be attached to the computer
	- the kernel starts the primordial process: init
	- init reads inittab, and starts any applicable programs listed there
		- one such program is what lets users login to the system: getty + login
			- kernel runs getty for each available terminal device
			- getty: initializes it, prints login prompt
			- when name entered, executes login program
			- the login program prompts for password
				- if correct -- spawn user's shell
				- if incorrect -- exit
			- if login (and getty) exited, init reaps the process and spawns another getty for the free device
	- if the connection was from the network, there is no getty -- but instead sshd/etc will spawn the login process
