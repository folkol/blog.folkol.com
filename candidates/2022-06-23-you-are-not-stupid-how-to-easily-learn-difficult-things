Single most life-changing skill I have taught myself: How to teach yourself.

Effective Self Teaching:
- context-broadening
	- place this topic into a broader context in the world, to make sense
	- "I have to understand the world, you see." —Feyman
	- Put curiosity and emotional investment at high levels.
	- One way is to google the topic, go to the news tab. What I am looking for is 'interesting things', like celebreties with MS, controversies around MS, etc.
	- Connect the topic ("MS") with preexisting things in your mind.
	- "Anchoring" things to MS specifics.
	- Visual imagery.
	- The doctor performed the 'Romberg's test'. Put your feed together and close your eyes. My legs gave out beneath me.
	- Using cane on a celebrity event.
	- Build vivid imagery, build intuition. Anchor things to things your already know.
- dopamine priming
	- Before tackling a topic, I need to understand the consequences of not learning it — and the benefits of learning it.
	- trying to frame it in a way that makes me emotionally invested, to make me itching to learn this.
	- try to find one or a few reason why you would really want to know about this. Like 'it is often misdiagnosed' etc.
	- Relate to yourself.
- singular deep dive
	- I don't do overviews, because I find that even if I am interested in the topic they bore me.
	- pinpoint specific thing, like e.g. the incontinence part of the story and find out exactly how MS causes incontinence.

		- nerve damage
			- myelination
			- what is myelin
			- feel free to follow any urges / side-quests, but make the jumps conciously — and always keep within the broader topic (MS, in this case)
		- leave when something else is more interested, and get back eventually
		- play with it!
		- Key for me: I only study what I feel of studying.
- challenge sandwich
	- If doing someting where it makes sense, try building a project with it or explain something particular with it.
	- If not, try to answer specific questions about the thing. For example, read case studies and try to explain the observations.
	- Be critical of what you read. Try to relate it with other possible approaches. Do not take it as gospel.
	- Relate facts to the scaffold / framework
		- Uhthoff's sign, symtomps gets worse with heat
	- Keep anchor stuff!
- getting broody
	- 'The mere-exposure effect'
	- I will brood on this.
	- I need to tell myself that no, I do not know this. There is A LOT that you don't know.
	- I will get back to this topic, do more deep dives. Maybe some spaced repetition. But in any case, don't fool yourself to believe that you already get this.
	- Put items in calendar to 'just think about this'.
	- Retention curves.
- false deadlines
