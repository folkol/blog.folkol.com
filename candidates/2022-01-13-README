Typography checklist for complex apps (free preview)

    I’ll save you 4 hours with this 2-word summary: use checklists! 🤓

    1. I’ve just dumped some labels and values onto a page. And that’s a fine way to start 👍
    2. First item on the list. Remove obvious labels. (like, 'task name', just place a heading with the name)
    3. Combine lables and values into human-readable phrases.
    4. Urgent: true|false -> "urgent!" or nothing?
    5. Display information visually. Joined 'assigned to' and 'due' into same line.
    6. Show what's actionable! E.g. replace 'date' with 'in 2 weeks' or 'tomorrow'.
