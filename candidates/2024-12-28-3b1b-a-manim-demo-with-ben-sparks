# A Manim demo with Ben Sparks

Use Manim Community version

- All scenes are classes (InteractiveScene)
- ipython REPL, connected to the scene
- 'checkpoint_paste()', the ipython repl will revert to a previous version
- anything can transform into anything, like the H of the text to the circle
- alot of things boil down to class Transform
- there is a hierarchy of objects, and can be groups
- everything is always 3D
- Mobject = Math Object
- 'set_points_as_corners'
- VGroup (vectorized objects)
- ipython embed used for Manim
- When the scene is done, we can render it:
	manim some_file.py WhichSceneClass --prerun --finder -w
	terminis
	drop into 'finalcut' and do the final editing
- 'mathpics', OCR but for math equations
