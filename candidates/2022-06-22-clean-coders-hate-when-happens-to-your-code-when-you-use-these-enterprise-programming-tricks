97 things every programmer should know

WordFriday on Facebook

'code written by some stranged on the internet is always perfect', or 'taking on needless dependencies'. Fragile Development Guide.

'fake oreilly covers' (o'reilly = o rly)

'developer vs programmer'
- there are a lot of developers that can't program

I've yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when you lookec at it in the right way, did not become still more complicated. —Anderson's law

If you say to people that 'this will take 6 months', they sure will fill those 6 months.

'FizzBuzz in Haskell by Embedding a Domain-Specific Language' —Maciej Piróg

If you can't dazzle people with brilliance — baffle them with bullshit!

A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament. —Oscar Wilde

Cargo Cult Programming, add structure that doesn't do anything.

Signal-to-noise-ratio.

Comments
Rob Pike: Notes on Programming in C, 'big block comment i = i + 1;'

A common fallacy is to assume authors of incomprehensible code will somehow be able to express themselves lucidly and clearly in comments.

If you need a large blob of shit (copyright, etc), but it in the end of the file and add a small reference in the top.

Clean Code —Uncle Bob, use wildcards

When all you have is a hammer, everything beings to look like thumb.
(...or everything begins to look like a screw!)

The name is not a mere label, the name is part of your design.

"noiseWords"

Object-oriented assembler.

Refactoring, improving the design of existing code. —Martin Fowler

When you communicate with others, try to see which words they use and which words you use. Are the words the right ones?

Names matter.

Refactoring (noun): a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behaviour.

Refactor (verb): to restructure software by applying a serires of refactorings without changing the observable behaviour of the software.

- rename
- remove
- move

A few smells:

- Singleton Configuration
- Singletons
- Verbose Naming
- Noisy Logging
	- we log everything
	- so you log the act of logging?
	- no, that would be silly! ...
	- so you log that assigment there?
	- no...
- log and throw
- repetition and duplication
- unnecessary code
- mixed levels of abstraction
	- business logic
	- bitshifting
	- socket connection
- legacy coding habits
- programming by coincidence
- programming by superstition

"Stringly typed language/system"

Poor code is seldom malicious, stupid or random. Pick a set of axioms ('style guides'), and the poor code will follow systematically.

If you can't construct the object, don't return an invalid object — throw. ("That's why constructors were originally created".)

TODO: Age histogram for lines of code.
TODO: touched-n-times per line of code.

Homeophatic Naming, diluted until it doesn't say anything.

"Wrong kind of failed binding".

aside:
	- Programmer Anarchy
	- why is the 'duct tape programmer' winning?
	- ATDD, Fit or Gherkin
	- Test-Driven Development —Kent Beck. Revisit it.
		- Avoid testing implementation details, test behaviors.
		- Test the public API.
	- Unit Test = Unit of isolation is the test, not the class. Kent Beck.
	- "Dependency is the key problem in software development at all scales" —Beck
	- Code Smells
		- Duplicated Code, Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies
		- Long Method, Lazy Class
		- Large Class, Speculative Generality
		- Long Parameter List, Message Chains
		- Divergent Change, Inappropriate Intimacy
		- Shotgun Surgery, Data Class
		- Feature Envy, Redused Bequest
		- Data Clumps, Comments
		- Primitive Obsession, Temporary Field
		- Switch Statements, Middle Man
	- POJO etc, objects without any dependencies. "Leaf objects".
	- ATDD = Acceptance TDD
