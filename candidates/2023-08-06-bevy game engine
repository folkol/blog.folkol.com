Resource: A mutable global.
- used for framework settings, if they are present they will do something
- something not attached to a game entity could be a resource
- "A system is function that runs at some point"	
- "SpriteBundle"
- "Struct update syntax"
- coordinates: 0,0 i middle, and every 1.0 is one (logical) pixel
- transform: translation, rotation, scale
- assets in './assets/' by default
- spawns entity, attaches components to it
- bundle: group of components, splatted
- ::<> <-- Turbofish
- added lots of derives, + PathLIke
- rapier is a physics engine, rapier2d is a plugin that uses rapier
- "Dynamic Rigid Body" is something that is not static, you can apply forces
- "damping", air resistance
- Restitution: How it "stops", bouncing
- ECS -- giant database table
- dampening -> imposes terminal velocity
- "continuous collision detection" if you have problems skipping through things
- WASM can't access very many cores, and can't now use network (much)?
- idiomatic asterisk include: preludes, in testing and enum with many variants in a local scope (scope). self::* sometimes
- game veloren, godo rust bindings
- rust user group
- ECS was 50 years ago, but coming back now
