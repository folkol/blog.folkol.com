V8 "engine" parts
TurboFan
Ignition
Crankshaft

Basically, it's called V8 because it is "a fast engine"? :)


	Just make sure you know where the walls and the doors are, you can always replace the contents of the room later —Dude fom Michaleus video

	Read: Interfaces and context!

objects 'types' are called 'shape'


Lab: loop through a lot of objects (with different shapes), do something with .x.
Compare time before and after sorting the array.
Cache churn?

Always construct the same type of objects!

More than 4 shapes -> don't inline but fall back to slow shit. Lookup type in pool instead (hash table?). LoadICTrampoline

(Info from 2017)

Always construct the same shapes!

For example, add same properties to all objects. Put undefined for unused properties.


Computed names in object literal definitions.



Try with Node.js or Chrome.

--trace-ic        # 
--trace-opt       # print optimization
--trace-deopt     # print deoptimization

	  --flag value  (non-bool flags only)
	  --            (captures all remaining args in JavaScript)
