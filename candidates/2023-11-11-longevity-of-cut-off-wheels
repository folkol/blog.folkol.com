# Optimizing the life of Cut-Off Wheels

"Since a few years 3M is commercializing CubitronTM II cut-off wheels. While
the quality has proven to be superior in the lab, this didn’t always show during demonstrations or tests at the end users."

"The life of the Cut-off wheels showed broad variation, on average exceeding 100% with peaks up to factor 6(!)"

Thickness: "On solid metal however all 1,6mm discs showed a longer life than there 1mm counterpart, on average 40% longer."


- On solid metal however all 1,6mm discs showed a longer life than there 1mm counterpart, on average 40% longer.
- The position of the wheel at the starting point did not show significant effect on the life of the disc.
- The distance to the support point proved to be a serious influencer. Comparing life cutting 1mm sheet on 3cm distance to the support point or on 1cm, life is reduced 30% to 60% with an average of approximately 50%.
- Test showed life of the cut-off wheel is on average 3 X longer when used “pulling” then when use “pushing”.
- On a 1700W right angled grinder 90% longer life can be expected compared with the same wheel on an 800W tool.
