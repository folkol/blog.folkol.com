# Put your mojo on the melody

If you want to do something well you have to practice, practice, practice — so that you can put your mojo on the melody!

Tommy Emmanuel said something that struck a chord with me on [Everything Music with Rick Beato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLIZZ9lIlwg&t=611s).

> I've played it many different ways, and I play it differently now to what I did two years ago — and I just played it a little differently then. Which tells you that *I'm free now*... I am not wrestling with the "skill" of playing this song. What I'm doing is *I'm putting my mojo on the melody*. All the rest of it is all taken care of because I've played it enough.

> When you are working out something like this... it's not music yet — it's skill.

> So you've gotta work out, carefully... and people don't wanna do this — but there is no other way! You've gotta start out bar by bar — little bit by little bit... and practice it and practice it and practice it until it comes together. And then something happens with our brain, *our attention suddenly goes to the melody*. And everything else starts to feel good, but our attention goes to the melody. [digression]. You work out the skill of playing it, and with enough playing — and enough dedication — that skill turns to music. And... girls and boys, that's a great reason to get out of bed!

This is also true for other things. If you practice something enough, the mundane details will fade out of mind — and you can focus your attention *on the melody*.
